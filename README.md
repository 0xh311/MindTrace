# MindTrace

MindTrace is a simple journaling app with a little AI twist.

## What it does

- Lets you write and save daily journal entries on your computer.
- After you write, it replies with a short AI-generated message based on what you wrote.
- No internet needed except for downloading the AI model at first.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
````

2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.

4. Install the required Python packages with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> This will install the AI libraries needed to run the app.

## Usage

1. In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   python mindtrace.py
   ```

2. The program will ask if you want to create a **New** journal entry or **Edit** today’s existing one. Type `N` for new or `E` to edit.

3. Start writing your journal. When you finish, press **ENTER** twice.

4. Your entry will be saved to a file named with today’s date inside a `MindTraceJournal` folder in your user directory.

5. After saving, the AI will reply with a short message responding to your journal entry.

6. You can run the program again any time to add more or read previous entries by choosing “Edit.”

## Future plans

* Add mood/emotion detection.
* Support for other languages.
* Make the AI remember past conversations.
* Build a simple graphical interface.
